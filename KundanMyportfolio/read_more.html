          Talking about my hobbies, I like to play cricket with my friends plant
          more and more plants, and read or explore technical terms, and I
          always try to share my knowledge because my father is from the Farmer
          Culture. I always try to do my work on my own. I look at life very
          positively. I am a firm believer in the fact that whatever happens,
          happens for a good reason. I have good communication skills. I can
          talk to any strange person very comfortably. I am also a good
          listener. Talking about My weakness is I trust people easily and Talk
          too much. My short-term goal is to become financially independent. My
          long-term goal is to become a highly skilled software engineer and
          learn the necessary skills. That's all about me.
